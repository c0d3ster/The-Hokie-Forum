----------THIS TEXT FILE WILL BE USED FOR IDEAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR ADVANCED FEATURES----------

1) The map on the individual thread page should be underneath the topic div on the right. 

	It would be cool if it also scrolled with the screen as you scrolled through the replies on the left UPDATE this is lookin like the best option, both the map and replies could scroll
                          -----------------OR--------------------
	If the map was static and instead the replies were inside a scrollable div. This would make the add reply box always visible. UPDATE doesnt seem like there's enough space to make this work where you can always see the reply box but if we moved replies to the right it would work


2) Possibly store last used "Topic Sort" tab into session storage, so heading can customized. Also possibly store the last page so we could add back buttons into individual thread views.

3) When clicking a pin from an individual thread's map, it would be ideal for information to pop up on the map with the location name (i.e. Cabo Fish Taco or an address) and the associated usernames of the replies

4) Use the id attribute to distinguish edit/delete button event listeners while using the class attribute to create event listeners for all of the buttons.

5) Rating system could go outside of topic and reply divs, another field would need to be added to the database though

6) Implement a Poll of the Week feature that uses external poll apis

7) Highlight reply box a different color when a pin is touched that is linked to it
