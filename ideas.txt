----------THIS TEXT FILE WILL BE USED FOR IDEAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR ADVANCED FEATURES----------

1) The map should scroll with the screen as you scrolled through the replies on the left 

2) Possibly store last used "Topic Sort" tab into session storage, so heading can customized. Also possibly store the last page so we could add back buttons into individual thread views.

3) When clicking a pin from an individual thread's map, it would be ideal for information to pop up on the map with the location name (i.e. Cabo Fish Taco or an address) and the associated usernames of the replies

5) Rating system could go outside of topic and reply divs, another field would need to be added to the database though

6) Implement a Poll of the Week feature that uses external poll apis

7) Highlight reply box a different color when a pin is touched that is linked to it

8) Random short funny messages populated on top right when logged in


To Do List:
-Categories
-add username to pin infobox
-Shift response box to right and scroll w/map
-endless scroll
-highlighting appropriate response (possibly scroll to it as well)
-add favorites to follow particular threads
-profile information and settings
-thread rating system
