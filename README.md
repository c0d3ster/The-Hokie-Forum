2) Possibly store last used "Topic Sort" tab into session storage, so heading can customized. Also possibly store the last page so we could add back buttons into individual thread views.

3) When clicking a pin from an individual thread's map, it would be ideal for information to pop up on the map with the location name (i.e. Cabo Fish Taco or an address) and the associated usernames of the replies

5) Rating system could go outside of topic and reply divs, another field would need to be added to the database though

6) Implement a Poll of the Week feature that uses external poll apis

8) Random short funny messages populated on top right when logged in

10) Map customization: move title long and lat boxes inside the map using negative margins, set radius to match farthest out pin on current map, style the info box to match our input box style, change pins to hokiebirds instead?


To Do List:
-Categories
-add username to pin infobox
-Shift response box to right and scroll w/map
-highlighting appropriate response (possibly scroll to it as well)
-profile information and settings
-thread rating system
